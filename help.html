      <h1>Welcome to Taskmaster Pro</h1>
      <p>Welcome to Taskmaster Pro, a todo app to stay productive and on top of your tasks.</p>
      <p>With this app you can create unlimited lists and tasks, set reminders to years in advance and everything is on IOS and your PC.</p>
<p>In the following sections, all features of this app are explained in detail. These features include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>add tasks with due date, a reminder message(if using a voice from the "choose voice menu"</li>
  <li>get reminded on the due date, even if a reminder was set for 5 minutes before, 2 days before, etc.</li>
  <li>notifies you about upcoming tasks as they are due and when a reminder was set both on PC and ios.</li>
  <li>requires an account if the tasks should be synced both on your PC and your phone</li>
  <li>Converts time zones automatically, so the date and time of due tasks display in your current time zone, no matter where you are located!</li>
  <li>Customize voice and speech settings for reminder messages, choosing from voices installed on your system. (if no voice is selected, the task will be announced and when it is due, on windows only)</li>
  <li>Upcoming tasks are displayed above your task lists, as well when they are overdue.</li>
</ul>
<a href="#setup" target="_blank"><h2>Setting it all up</h2></a>
<p id="setup">Now that you know all about the features, it's time to create an account and start using the app.</p>
<p>I removed the guest mode because saving tasks on the Git Hub Pages and saving them in local storage was conflicting with saving tasks when logged in.</p>
<a href="#account" target="_blank"><h2>1. Creating an account and adding your first list</h2></a>
<p id="account">Click on the "Create account/sign in". On the page there are headings for "sign up" and "sign in". When you don't have an account yet, navigate to "sign up" and enter your username, email and password. If you want, you can sign up with google using the "continue with google" button.</p>
<p>After signing up, you are automatically logged in. You can see it because now it says "welcome" and then your chosen name at the top of the taskmaster pro's page. On Windows you stay signed in forever unless you clear your browser's cookies, on IOS you have to sign in every time you open your ios shortcut (more on adding the website as a shortcut later).</p>
<p>If I know how to fix it so that you are always signed in on IOS regardless of your app open or not, I let you know in the "Latest Changes" section.</p>
<p>Let's create your first list next!</p>
